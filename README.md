# My OneApp — M-PESA clone (reconstructed)

A React Native + Expo (SDK 55, expo-router) mobile app: a Safaricom M-PESA–style
wallet front end with registration, PIN login, a balance dashboard, and
money-movement screens, talking to the [Invest254](https://github.com/mitasafi89-dot/invest254)
backend at `https://invest254.com` (REST under `/api/v1`).

> ## 🔌 Backend: Invest254
> The app authenticates against the Invest254 REST API (phone + password + JWT) and reads
> the player wallet. Because the M-PESA-style UI is phone + 4-digit PIN, the API client
> (`src/api/client.ts`) deterministically derives a backend-valid username and password from
> the inputs the user already provides. This is a **demo bridge** — replace it with a real
> password flow before production use.

> ## ⚠️ How this repository was produced
> The original project source was lost. This codebase was **reconstructed by
> decompiling the shipped APK's Hermes bytecode bundle** (`assets/index.android.bundle`)
> and rebuilding the logic, screens, API layer, theme and data model in clean,
> typed source. It is **behaviour-faithful, not byte-identical** to the lost
> original. JSX/styling is a faithful re-creation from the recovered layout,
> colours (`#4CAF50` brand green), keypad layout, strings and flows.
>
> While reconstructing it, a real production bug was found and **fixed** (see below),
> and several security/PII problems from the original were **removed**.

## 🐛 The PIN bug that prompted this rebuild — fixed

**Symptom:** "the app won't accept the PIN the user sets."

**Root cause (confirmed live against the backend):** new accounts are gated behind
manual approval. Registering returns `200 {success:true}`, but logging in with the
**correct** PIN returns `403 {"error":"Your account is pending approval…"}`. The
original login screen only checked `response.ok`, so it treated that 403 — and 404s
and network errors — as a **wrong PIN**, decremented the attempt counter, and
**locked the account after 3 tries**. The string "pending approval" wasn't even
present in the app, so it could never be shown.

**Fix (this repo):** `src/api/client.ts#login` returns a typed outcome and
`app/pin.tsx` branches on it:

| Server | Outcome | UI behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `200` | success | go to `/home` |
| `401 Invalid PIN` | `wrong_pin` | count attempt, show "N attempts left", lock at 3 |
| `403 pending approval` | `pending_approval` | show the real message, **no strike, no lock** |
| `404 User not found` | `not_registered` | route to `/register` |
| network / `5xx` | `network_error` / `server_error` | friendly retry, **no strike** |

A standalone annotated reference of the fix is in [`docs/login.fixed.reference.ts`](docs/login.fixed.reference.ts).

## 🚀 Getting started

```bash
npm install            # or: npx expo install (recommended to resolve SDK 55 versions)
cp .env.example .env   # set EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE if different
npx expo start         # press a (Android) / i (iOS) / w (web)
```

Build native binaries with EAS or `npx expo run:android` (requires Android SDK).

## 📦 Fidelity (read this)
- **`original/` is byte/pixel-exact** — copied verbatim from the APK (bundle,
  manifest, config, strings, colors, all raster images incl. the real launcher
  icon `res-images/sK.webp`).
- **`app/` + `src/` are a faithful reconstruction**, not the original source
  files. Release **Hermes bytecode is lossy/one-way**: it permanently discards
  original file boundaries, comments, formatting, types and (in release) variable
  names, so byte-exact *source* cannot be recovered from any RN/Expo APK. Behaviour,
  screens, strings, keypad, colors and the API contract are reproduced exactly.
  Full statement: [`docs/REVERSE_ENGINEERING.md`](docs/REVERSE_ENGINEERING.md).

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the data flow and backend contract.

## 🔐 Backend API (current app integration)

- `POST /api/v1/auth/register` `{ phone, username, password }` -> `201 { token, userId, role }` | `409`
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` `{ phone, password }` -> `200 { token, userId, role }` | `401` | `403`
- `GET /api/v1/wallet` (Bearer token) -> `200 { real, bonus, currency }` (cents)
- `GET /api/v1/auth/me` (Bearer token) -> `200 { userId, role, username, phone }`

The app keeps a PIN UI and deterministically derives backend credentials in `src/api/client.ts`.

> Note: the live web domain `https://invest254.com` is reachable, but from this environment
> `/api/v1/health` returned `404`. If your API is exposed on a different host/path, set
> `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE` to that value.

## 🔧 Changes vs. the original (intentional)

- **Bug fix:** status-aware PIN login (above).
- **Security:** removed hardcoded PII + default `pin:"1234"` from the bundle;
  dropped risky permissions (`SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`, legacy storage); `allowBackup:false`;
  renamed package to `com.example.oneapp` (the original impersonated Safaricom).
- **Robustness:** canonical phone normalization shared by register/login/balance;
  request timeouts; typed outcomes.

These and the remaining backend hardening items (auth tokens, server-side rate
limiting, PIN hashing) are tracked in [`docs/AUDIT.md`](docs/AUDIT.md) §4–§6.
